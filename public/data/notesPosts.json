          "Introduction":
              "    So you are a marketer. Creating huge value for big companies. And your boss asks you to write up a proposal. Or maybe to create a presentation? You muster the content, you put it together and... the design looks like shit. You are stressed... (just kidding, you should not stress so easily). The idea for this article came to me, after I got tired, of reviewing my non-designer friends designs for presentations, proposals, etc. In my opinion eveyone working in marketing, should grasp atleast some design basics. So, treat this list as it is. Simple check list for non-designers, to help with their designs.",
